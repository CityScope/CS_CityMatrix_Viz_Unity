## Description
Have you ever wanted to make software for people with visual impairment or who have difficulties reading? 
Do you have lazy players who don't like to read too much? Or do you even want to test your game's voice dialogues without having to pay a voice actor yet? 
With RT-Voice this is very easily done – it's a major time saver!

RT-Voice uses the computer's (already implemented) TTS (text-to-speech) voices to turn the written lines into speech and dialogue at run-time! 
Therefore, all text in your game/app can be spoken out loud to the player.

And all of this without any intermediate steps: The transformation is instantaneous and simultaneous (if needed)!

Please read the "RTVoice-doc.pdf" and "RTVoice-api.pdf" for more details.
